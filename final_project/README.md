This is the final project for the second iteration of the Unallocated Space (http://www.unallocatedspace.org/) FPGA class.

The goal is to create a spectrum analyzer with a VGA monitor as the display.

The blocks will include (subject to change):
  ADC
  DDS (for test signal generation)
  FFT (Xilinx IP Core)
  Magnitude calculator
  VGA

There will be various FIFO and RAM elements to connect each of the blocks.
